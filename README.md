# Gesture-Detection-and-Air-Draw
This consist of two modules (gesture and point- two separate functionalities) linked thorugh a common runtime file.
The gesture file provides functionalities of recognising the hand gestures and the point function locates the coordinates of the single finger.

Original dataset acquired from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers"> Kaggle Finger Dataset </a> and was modified after applying masks and thresholds.
